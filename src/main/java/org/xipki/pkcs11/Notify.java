   * The module calls this method in certain events. 'Surrender' is the only
   * event defined by now. If the application wants to return an error code,
   * it can do this using PKCS11Exceptions. Throwing no exception means a
   * return value of CKR_OK, and throwing a PKCS11Exception means a return
   * value of the error code of the exception; e.g.<code><br>
   * throw new PKCS11Exception(CKR_CANCEL);<br>
   * </code><br>
   * causes a return value of CKR_CANCEL.
   *
   * @param session
   *          The session performing the callback.
   * @param event
   *          See CK_NOTIFICATION in PKCS#11. A return value of CKR_OK is
   *          generated, if this method call returns regularly.
   *          CKR_CANCEL can be returned to the module by throwing a
   *          PKCS11Exception with the error-code CKR_CANCEL.
   *          Till version 2.4 only CKN_SURRENDER is defined.
   * @param application
   *          The application-object passed to openSession.
   * @exception PKCS11Exception
   *              If the method fails for some reason, or as PKCS11Exception
   *              with error-code CKR_CANCEL to signal the module to cancel
   *              the ongoing operation.
